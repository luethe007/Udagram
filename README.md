# Udagram Image Filtering Application

This project is part of the Cloud Developer Nanodegree at Udacity.  

Udagram is a simple cloud application. It allows users to register and log into a web client, post photos to the feed, and process photos using an image filtering microservice.  

The task was decompose a Monolith application into Microservices. The Udagram
application is split into the following components:  
- Frontend
- Reverseproxy
- Feed Backend
- Users Backend.

Each of these components are containerized and deployed to a Kubernetes cluster on AWS.  
You can check my infrastructure in the /screenshots folder.  

Feel free to provide me any feedback.

# Udagram Image Filtering Application

This project is part of the Cloud Developer Nanodegree at Udacity.  

Udagram is a simple cloud application. It allows users to register and log into a web client, post photos to the feed, and process photos using an image filtering microservice.  

The task was decompose a Monolith application into Microservices. The Udagram
application is split into the following components:  
- Frontend
- Reverseproxy
- Feed Backend
- Users Backend.

Each of these components have been containerized and deployed to a Kubernetes cluster on AWS to pass the Microservices project. The app was only hosted for the sake of this project, so it is not available anymore.

You can check my infrastructure in the /screenshots folder.  

Feel free to provide me any feedback.
